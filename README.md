# DeepSpaceCollection

A collection of interesting deep-space objects visualized using publicly available data from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.

This repository aims to showcase the beauty and complexity of the universe. All images are created using data obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST), a vast repository of astronomical data from various NASA missions, including the Hubble Space Telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, and others.

## About MAST

The Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) provides free access to a wealth of astronomical data. This data is invaluable for scientific research and also serves as a fantastic resource for creating stunning visualizations of celestial objects.

## Current Objects

### Pillars of Creation (M16)

The Pillars of Creation are an iconic formation of interstellar gas and dust within the Eagle Nebula (Messier 16). These towering structures are sculpted by powerful stellar winds from young, hot stars and are actively forming new stars within their dense clouds. The image reveals intricate details of the pillars' structure, including dark dust lanes and bright regions of ionized gas.

### Stephan's Quintet (HCG 92)

Stephan's Quintet is a visual grouping of five galaxies located in the constellation Pegasus. Four of these galaxies form a true physical group, engaged in a cosmic dance of gravitational interaction. The interactions between these galaxies trigger intense bursts of star formation and distort their shapes, creating a dynamic and captivating scene. The image captures the intricate details of these galactic interactions, including tidal tails and distorted galactic disks.

### Orion Nebula (M42) - Close-up

This close-up view of the Orion Nebula (M42) reveals the intricate details of this stellar nursery. The bright central region is dominated by a group of young, massive stars whose intense radiation ionizes the surrounding gas, causing it to glow. Wisps of gas and dust create a complex tapestry of light and dark, showcasing the ongoing process of star formation within this dynamic region.
